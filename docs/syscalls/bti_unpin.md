## DESCRIPTION

**bti_unpin**() unpins pages that were previously pinned by **mx_bti_pin**(),
and revokes the access that was granted by the pin call.

*addrs* and *addrs_len* must refer to an array with exactly the same elements
that were returned by a call to **mx_btin_pin**().

## RETURN VALUE

On success, **bti_unpin**() returns NO_ERROR.
In the event of failure, a negative error value is returned.

## ERRORS

**ERR_BAD_HANDLE**  *bti* is not a valid handle.

**ERR_WRONG_TYPE**  *bti* is not a BTI handle.

**ERR_ACCESS_DENIED** *bti* does not have the *MX_RIGHT_MAP*.

**ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  The requested range was not previously returned by
**mx_bti_pin**().
